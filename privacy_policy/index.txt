7:T4d8,Certain Users choose to interact with Intro in ways that require Intro to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Intro gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a account at intro.io to provide a name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Intro - by purchasing access to Intro's paid services for example - are asked to provide additional information, including necessary personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Intro collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Intro. The purpose of collecting the Personally-Identifying Information is to give those Users a better experience of the product, better security and control, and to be able to better improve the product based on User feedbac (ie bug tracking, error reports etc). Intro does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described in this agreement. Users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.8:T6dd,Intro discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Intro's behalf or to provide services available at Intro's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Intro's websites you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Intro will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Intro discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Intro believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Intro, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Intro website and have supplied your email address, Intro may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Intro and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Intro takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.0:{"P":null,"b":"kmC_V3Mb3zxOqUQ7cTFhl","p":"/intro_landing_may","c":["","privacy_policy",""],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["privacy_policy",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/intro_landing_may/_next/static/css/c92f29fd17d33440.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"__variable_63e965
