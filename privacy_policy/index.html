WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2><h3 class="uppercase">IN PLAIN ENGLISH</h3><p>We collect information on potential candidate that is publically available and relevant for our users and business partners. This may include name, email address, location, profile photo, candidate&#x27;s user name on online forum and content/posts on online forums. We also collect mostly information on users of our plugin and website that is typically not personally identifiable, unless the user has voluntarily made it identifiable.</p><h3 class="uppercase">MORE DETAILED</h3><p>We collect two main categories of information. The first category (i.e. &quot;Business Profiles&quot;) is what is available in Intro&#x27;s Search Engine and shared with our Users and business partners. The second category (i.e. &quot;User&#x27;s Data&quot;) is collected to allow Users to use our Plugin, Website and other related services and products.</p><h3 class="uppercase">1. BUSINESS PROFILES</h3><p>We collect Business Profiles that are related to individuals from different public sources in order to enhance, optimize and enrich Intro&#x27;s Search Engine and keep it current and up to date as possible. We collect information about Candidates from publicly available sources, such as via the Internet and social networks, including through public or licensed APIs. For example, we use open web services and APIs to complete and update the information we have about Candidates and enrich it (e.g. by adding links to Candidates&#x27; verified social network profiles), in order to allow our Users and business partners to find relevant Business Profiles.</p><p>Intro always strives to limit the amount of personal data that we process on an individual to the absolute minimum needed to provide the Service, ie facilitate matching between employers and employees. The personal data we obtain and gather in Business Profiles may never include more than:</p><ul><li>Name</li><li>Email address</li><li>Location</li><li>Profile photo on a publically accessible online source</li><li>Candidate&#x27;s user name on online forums</li><li>Content/posts on the Internet</li></ul><h3 class="uppercase">2. USER&#x27;S DATA</h3><p>Intro collects both personally-identifying and non-personally-identifying information of Users. The personally-identifying information only applies to registered Users, Users of Intro&#x27;s plugin and paying Users under Intro&#x27;s Terms of Service. For all other categories Users (eg non-registered visitors to the Site), we only collect non-personally-identifying information.</p><h3 class="uppercase">3. GATHERING OF NON-PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h3><p>Intro collects non-personally-identifying information of Users of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Intro&#x27;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Intro&#x27;s visitors use its website and to better provide related content to its visitors. From time to time, Intro may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Intro also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Intro only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p><h3 class="uppercase">4. GATHERING OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h3><p>Certain Users choose to interact with Intro in ways that require Intro to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Intro gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a account at intro.io to provide a name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Intro - by purchasing access to Intro&#x27;s paid services for example - are asked to provide additional information, including necessary personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Intro collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor&#x27;s interaction with Intro. The purpose of collecting the Personally-Identifying Information is to give those Users a better experience of the product, better security and control, and to be able to better improve the product based on User feedbac (ie bug tracking, error reports etc). Intro does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described in this agreement. Users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p><h3 class="uppercase">5.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Intro&#x27;s websites you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Intro will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Intro discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Intro believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Intro, third parties or the public at large.
